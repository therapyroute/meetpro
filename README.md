# Getting Started

## üè¢ **Self-Hosted**

You can install MeetPro yourself. It's free, but you are responsible for managing it. See [here](#reasons-for-open-sourcing). 

### Here's how:  ###

* [Clone](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) this repo to your server
* Ensure [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/) & Docker Compose are installed at your server
* Create app/settings.json (copy from app/settings-sample.json). See [here](#settings).
* Create .env (copy from .env-sample and replace your app deployment url in APP_ROOT_URL)
* Run ``deploy.sh``
* Go to your APP_ROOT_URL and login with:
* Username: the email you set at the settings' ADMIN_EMAIL and password: mypass@321
<br>

### Demo ###

## Reasons for open sourcing ##
Despite our best efforts to establish MeetPro as a robust SaaS offering, various challenges prevented us from realizing this vision. From resource constraints to market complexities, the path forward became increasingly difficult. Believing in the potential of this tool and its potential to benefit the community, we've decided to open-source MeetPro. By sharing the codebase, we hope to empower developers and organizations to build upon our work, fostering innovation and collaboration. If you find MeetPro valuable and are willing to extend its capabilities, we encourage you to share your improvements with the community. Your contributions can help shape the future of this project.
